  <h1>Understanding computers</h1>
  <h2>First: what is computer?</h2>
  <p>A <strong>computer</strong> is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to <strong>store, retrieve, and process</strong> data. You may already know that you can use a computer to <strong>type documents, send email, play games</strong>, and <strong>browse the Web</strong>. You can also use it to edit or create 
<strong>spreadsheets, presentations</strong>, and even <strong>videos</strong>.</p>
  
  <div id="hard"><h2>Hardware</h2>
  <p> <strong>Hardware</strong> is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer's internal parts, which you can see in the image below.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>CPU</li>
    <p>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the most important processor in a given computer. Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output operations. </p>

    <li>RAM</li>
    <p>Random-access memory is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.066a837fc27404cd53508a56d97c4b10?rik=vMya9ifo6AHIEA&riu=http%3a%2f%2fcomputercures.com.au%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f12%2fRAM.jpg&ehk=mVJwgFftcmUD%2fvMR3K9SFNQczCH5%2bQxRqM5B9ei3eBM%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" height="200" width="400"></p>
    <li>Sound card</li>
    <p>A sound card (also known as an audio card) is an internal expansion card that provides input and output of audio signals to and from a computer under the control of computer programs. The term sound card is also applied to external audio interfaces used for professional audio applications.</p>

    <li>Keyboard</li>
    <p>A computer keyboard is a peripheral input device modeled after the typewriter keyboard which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Replacing early punched cards and paper tape technology, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards have been the main input method for computers since the 1970s, supplemented by the computer mouse since the 1980s.</p>

  <h2>Software</h2>
  <p>Software is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. Examples of software include web browsers, games, and word processors.</p>
  <p>The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages.[2] High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler, an interpreter, or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language that has a strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler.</p>
  <h2>Technology </h2>
  <p>The word computer derived from the English word “computer” which means the calculator. At the beginning of computer technology, the primary purpose of the computer system was to provide calculation and computing solutions for the problems. But in the current era, the primary use of the computer technology is not just limited to the calculations only.</p>

<p>Computer technology has achieved new limits, and we can see the use of computer technology in every field of life. Data processing and management of information has become the critical factors of computer technology. With the help of computers technology, we can store data and can access any information from anywhere.</p>
